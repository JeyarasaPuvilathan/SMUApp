Part C OF Question 1
-------------------------
If ListA and ListB contain 100 million elements each, how will you rewrite your three functions to make it as fast as possible?

Answer:-
---------------------
we can rewrite the three functions to make them as fast as possible using parallel processing.
We can use the Parallel class from the System.Threading.Tasks namespace to process the lists in parallel, splitting the work across multiple threads. 


QUSTION 2

CREATE PROCEDURE GetProgrammeSummary
AS
BEGIN
  SELECT
    p.ProgrammeID,
    p.ProgrammeName,
    COUNT(*) AS NumStudents,
    SUM(CASE WHEN s.Gender = 'M' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NumMaleStudents,
    SUM(CASE WHEN s.Gender = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NumFemaleStudents,
    SUM(CASE WHEN s.MobilePhone IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NumStudentsWithMobilePhone
  FROM
    StudentProgramme p
    JOIN StudentProgramme sp ON p.ProgrammeID = sp.ProgrammeID
    JOIN Students s ON sp.StudentID = s.StudentID
  GROUP BY
    p.ProgrammeID,
    p.ProgrammeName;
END
